# Gemini CLI Git Automation Scripts

This project provides a set of Zsh scripts designed to automate common Git workflows using the power of the Gemini AI.

## Features

### `auto_commit.zsh`
- **Automated Commit Message Generation**: Generates concise and conventional Git commit messages based on staged changes and recent commit history using Gemini.
- **Interactive Feedback Loop**: Allows users to provide feedback to regenerate commit messages for improved accuracy.
- **Staging Assistant**: Prompts to stage all changes if no changes are currently staged.
- **Optional Push**: Offers to push changes to the remote repository after a successful commit.

### `auto_pr.zsh`
- **Automated Pull Request Creation**: Generates pull request titles and descriptions based on the commit history between the current branch and the base branch (main/master) using Gemini.
- **Issue Reference Inclusion**: Automatically includes relevant issue references (e.g., `resolves #123`, `fixes #456`) found in commit messages.
- **GitHub CLI Integration**: Integrates with the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to create pull requests directly from the command line.

## Usage

To use these scripts, ensure you have the `gemini` command-line tool installed and configured, as well as the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for `auto_pr.zsh`.

### `auto_commit.zsh`
```bash
./auto_commit.zsh [optional_additional_context]
```
Run this script in your Git repository when you have staged changes. It will propose a commit message and guide you through the commit process.

### `auto_pr.zsh`
```bash
./auto_pr.zsh [optional_additional_context]
```
Run this script on a feature branch to generate and create a pull request. It will analyze your commit history and suggest a PR title and description.

## Requirements
- Zsh shell
- Git
- Gemini command-line tool (configured with access to Gemini models)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) (for `auto_pr.zsh` functionality)

## How to Use

To run the scripts, simply drag the `.zsh` file into your terminal window (e.g., in VS Code or iTerm2) and press Enter. This will execute the script directly.

### Example Usage: `auto_commit.zsh`

### Known Issue: Gemini Response Trimming

Occasionally, the Gemini model might include an extraneous line (e.g., related to authentication methods) at the beginning of its response. To mitigate this, our scripts trim the first line of every Gemini output. In cases where Gemini *does not* include this extra line, the trimming might result in an empty or truncated message.

**Workaround**: If you encounter an empty or incomplete message, simply choose the 'regenerate with feedback' option (`r`) and Gemini will typically provide a complete response on the next attempt. You can also explicitly ask Gemini to add a new line at the start of its response if this issue persists.

sample_title="feat(auto-commit): Enhance PR update, fix PR number generation, and improve display rendering"

sample_body='## Summary

- Implemented automatic PR update for existing branches, streamlining continuous development workflows.
- Significantly improved the robustness and accuracy of PR number generation and handling within `gh pr edit` commands, addressing persistent issues.
- Enhanced PR content generation by providing the LLM with full context, leading to more comprehensive and relevant titles and bodies.
- Introduced markdown rendering and display width adjustments for PR body content, improving readability in the terminal.
- Refactored PR content parsing for increased robustness and streamlined update logic.

## Recent Changes

- Automatic PR Update: Enhanced `auto_commit.zsh` to detect unpushed commits on branches with open PRs and provide an interactive flow to update them.
- PR Number Fixes:
  - Introduced `PR_NUMBER_PLACEHOLDER` and `sed` replacement to ensure correct PR numbers.
  - Corrected prompt instructions for LLM to use placeholders effectively.
  - Built `gh pr edit` command internally from LLM output, ensuring accuracy.
  - Added validation and auto-correction for PR numbers in LLM-generated commands.
- Improved PR Content Generation:
  - Passed all PR commits and existing PR content to the LLM for more context-aware updates.
  - Delegated full `gh pr edit` command generation to the LLM for flexibility.
- Display Enhancements:
  - Implemented markdown rendering for PR bodies using `gum format`.
  - Correctly nested `gum format` within `gum style` for consistent rendering.
  - Added `--width` parameter to `gum style` to adjust PR body display width, preventing overflow.
- Code Refinements:
  - Replaced `jq` with a Python script for more robust PR content parsing.
  - Streamlined PR update logic by merging conditional flows.
  - Replaced `echo` with `colored_status` for consistent and readable output.

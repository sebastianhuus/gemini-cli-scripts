# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains Zsh automation scripts that use the Gemini CLI to automate Git workflows and GitHub issue management. The scripts leverage AI to generate commit messages, pull request descriptions, and handle issue operations through natural language processing.

## Core Scripts

### Main Automation Scripts

#### auto_commit.zsh
Automated commit message generation using Gemini CLI with feedback loops:
- Analyzes staged changes and recent commit history
- Generates conventional commit messages 
- Interactive feedback mechanism for message refinement
- Optional push to remote after commit

Usage: `./auto_commit.zsh [optional_context]`

#### auto_pr.zsh  
Pull request creation automation:
- Analyzes commit differences between current branch and main/master
- Generates PR titles and descriptions
- Extracts issue references from commit messages
- Integrates with GitHub CLI for PR creation

Usage: `./auto_pr.zsh [optional_context]`

#### auto_issue.zsh
Natural language GitHub issue management:
- Two-stage processing: question conversion â†’ intent parsing
- Supports create, edit, comment, view operations
- LLM-enhanced content generation for issue bodies and comments
- Repository context awareness (labels, milestones, collaborators)
- Priority label support for visual issue urgency indication

Usage: `./auto_issue.zsh "natural language request"`

### Utility Scripts (utils/)

#### utils/gemini_clean.zsh
Utility script for cleaning Gemini CLI responses:
- Removes authentication-related lines that can appear at response start
- Prevents command execution failures when auth messages get included
- Used by all other scripts via pipe: `gemini ... | "${script_dir}/utils/gemini_clean.zsh"`

Usage: `gemini -m model --prompt "..." | ./utils/gemini_clean.zsh`

#### utils/gemini_context.zsh
Repository context utility for enhanced AI understanding:
- Loads and formats GEMINI.md file content for LLM context
- Provides functions: `load_gemini_context()` and `has_gemini_context()`
- Automatically sourced by main scripts when available
- File size validation (max 2KB) to prevent token overuse

Usage: Automatically loaded by main scripts when present


## Architecture

### Common Patterns
- All scripts use `gemini-2.5-flash` model via Gemini CLI
- Consistent attribution footer: `ðŸ¤– Generated with [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)`
- Error handling with fallback to manual operation
- Interactive confirmation before execution

### Key Functions in auto_issue.zsh
- `convert_question_to_command()`: Converts conversational requests to direct commands
- `parse_intent()`: Extracts structured data (operation, issue number, content) from natural language
- `confirm_operation()`: Validates and confirms operations before execution
- `dispatch_operation()`: Routes to appropriate handler functions
- `create_issue_with_llm()`: LLM-controlled issue creation with repository context
- `edit_issue()` / `comment_issue()`: Issue modification operations

### Two-Stage Processing in auto_issue.zsh
1. **Question Detection & Conversion**: Handles polite/conversational requests
2. **Intent Parsing**: Extracts structured operation data from direct commands

## Dependencies

Required tools:
- Zsh shell
- Git
- Gemini CLI (`gemini` command)
- GitHub CLI (`gh` command)

## Issue Priority Labels

This repository uses priority labels to provide visual indicators of issue urgency and guide work prioritization:

### Priority Label System
- **`priority:critical`** - ðŸ”´ Critical priority (Red #FF0000)
  - Urgent, blocking issues requiring immediate attention
  - System outages, security vulnerabilities, or complete feature failures
  
- **`priority:high`** - ðŸŸ  High priority (Orange #FF6600)
  - Important, time-sensitive issues
  - Significant feature enhancements, performance issues, or user experience problems
  
- **`priority:normal`** - ðŸ”µ Normal priority (Blue #0099FF)
  - Standard workflow priority
  - Regular feature requests, minor improvements, or standard bug fixes
  
- **`priority:low`** - ðŸŸ¢ Low priority (Green #66CC00)
  - Nice-to-have, non-urgent issues
  - Code cleanup, documentation updates, or minor enhancements

### Usage Guidelines
- **No priority label** implies normal priority (standard workflow)
- Priority labels work seamlessly with the existing `auto_issue.zsh` script
- Labels are automatically discovered and available for AI-assisted issue management
- Use priority labels during issue creation or apply them during triage

### Examples with auto_issue.zsh
```bash
# Create issue with priority label
./auto_issue.zsh "create critical issue about login system down"

# Add priority label to existing issue
./auto_issue.zsh "add priority:high label to issue 42"

# Create issue and let AI determine priority
./auto_issue.zsh "create issue about slow page loading"
```

## Common Commands

Since this is a shell script repository without build systems:

### Testing Scripts
```bash
# Test in a git repository with staged changes
./auto_commit.zsh "fix login bug"

# Test PR creation from feature branch  
./auto_pr.zsh "resolves #123"

# Test issue management
./auto_issue.zsh "create issue about dark mode"
./auto_issue.zsh "comment on issue 5 that this is resolved"
```

### Installation Pattern
Designed to be used as a git submodule:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/sebastianhuus/gemini-cli-scripts.git <path>
git submodule update --remote  # For updates
```

## Development Notes

### Adding New Operations to auto_issue.zsh
1. Update `parse_intent()` function with new operation types
2. Add validation in `confirm_operation()` function  
3. Create new operation handler function following existing patterns
4. Update `dispatch_operation()` with new case
5. Update help documentation

### Gemini Response Handling
- All scripts use `utils/gemini_clean.zsh` utility to clean auth-related output from responses
- Handles "Loaded cached credentials." and similar auth messages that sometimes appear
- Retry mechanism available in auto_commit.zsh via regeneration option
- Error checking for failed LLM calls with fallback messages
- Repository context loading via `utils/gemini_context.zsh` for enhanced AI understanding

### Attribution Pattern
All generated content includes attribution footer for transparency and compliance with LLM usage policies.

## Zsh Scripting Tips
- If you are going to use ``` inside of zsh scripts, remember to escape it like \``` so that it doesnt accidentally open a quote block
